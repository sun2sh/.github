# ONDC - Open Network for Digital Commerce

ONDC is an ambitious initiative to democratize digital commerce by creating a decentralized network of buyer apps and seller apps through an interoperable protocol specification.

## Overview

This comprehensive guide is designed to walk you through the process of integrating your digital commerce platform with the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC). By following these steps, you'll enable seamless interoperability with the decentralized network, allowing your platform to leverage the benefits of ONDC.

## Getting Started

The [ONDC Participant Portal](https://portal.ondc.org/) serves as a self-service platform that streamlines interaction between ONDC and its network participants across their entire lifecycle. "Network player" encompasses network participants, ecosystem partners, and other entities engaged with ONDC. The portal provides access to a range of services for network players, such as self-service onboarding, self-monitored compliance, and self-monitored operations. Creating an account on ONDC Participant Portal is mandatory for starting your integration with ONDC.

## Quick Start Guide

[ONDC Integration Guide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1HPRXk3lVYKmyAFcApgukZuwHhIZ_VlqR/edit#slide=id.g27b2e3e34a2_28_199) is a roadmap designed to illuminate key resources and navigate through the integration journey. 

## The Protocol

**[Beckn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gefmygtzZR8&t=1s)** is an open protocol that allows local businesses across any industry to be discovered and engaged by any beckn-enabled application. **Beckn protocol** is a collection of open specifications consisting of protocol APIs, message formats, network design and reference architectures to allow any two entities to execute commercial transactions without being on the same platform. 

**ONDC** has provided the network extension layer over the Beckn Protocol (base layer). Over the base layer, the network extension layer comprises **model specifications** customised to the ONDC context that have been adopted in order to facilitate transactions over the network. For a detailed understanding of the ONDC network architecture, please refer to our [Tech Briefing Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17mJ_zPjEYPagc5PZuw7FS3Ftcc-Gop4U6536wStRSag/edit#slide=id.g1204a6ff419_0_56) and [Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WuHCc59C45LClpbiIPomPMuTeClRZw7h/view).

### Subscription Process

To enroll in the ONDC network, Network Participants (NP) must be added to the registry. The steps for an NP to onboard onto the ONDC Registry (Staging, Pre Production, Production) are outlined as follows:

1. **Staging Registry**

   - Obtain whitelisting for the subscriber ID by submitting the request via ONDC Participant Portal
   - Initiate the subscription process by calling the /subscribe API.
     The complete process is documented [here](https://github.com/ONDC-Official/developer-docs/blob/main/registry/Onboarding%20of%20Participants.md)
2. **Pre-Production Registry**

   After presenting a demo and receiving approval from the relevant team, follow the [outlined process](https://github.com/ONDC-Official/developer-docs/blob/main/registry/Onboarding%20of%20Participants.md) to be added to the Pre-Prod registry. 
3. **Production Registry**
   Upon successfully completing functional testing and satisfying the final checklist in Pre-Production, an NP can transition to the the Production environment.

### Signing and Verification

When communicating over HTTP using Beckn APIs, the subscribers need to authenticate themselves to perform transactions with other subscribers. Due to the commercial nature of the transactions, every request/callback pair is considered to be a "contract" between two parties. Therefore, it is imperative that all requests and callbacks are digitally signed by the sender and subsequently verified by the receiver.

The complete process is documented [here](https://github.com/ONDC-Official/developer-docs/blob/main/registry/signing-verification.md).
